# EJB-dispatcher configuration for DRbServers.
#
# The servers provide EJB connection for remote ActiveEJB clients.
# All communication is carried over by TCP, even when the client and host
# are physically the same. You must secure the connection yourself,
# which can be done by SSH port forwarding.
#
# This configures a DRbServer instance.
# Instances configured here are automatically picked up by EJB-dispatcher daemon
# when it is started from the main hub directory, one step down from config.
#

example:
  hostname: localhost
  port:		9876
  class:	EJB::Example

# Multiple EJBs can be freely added.
#
#	another_example:
#		hostname:	localhost
#		port:		9876
#		class:		EJB::NameFreely

# Logging is hard-coded to STDOUT.
