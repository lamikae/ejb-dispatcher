= Notes on tests
EJB-dispatcher has a test suite that tests the dispatcher itself, not any EJB methods.
You will need to write the tests for any 3rd party EJBs you may want to use.
Examples will be provided.

Currently the test suite *does not run* without proprietary Oracle RMI JARs placed to +vendor/lib/java+.


= Notes on RMI/ORMI:

Only ORMI is tested. RMI should act just as fine, but it needs subtle changes in the code.
Contact the author for support.

If you however would like to use ORMI, just drop the required JARs to vendor/lib/java.
